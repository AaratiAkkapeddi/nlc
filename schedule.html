    <h1>Next Level Coding Spring 2026</h1>
    <p>SPRING 2026, WEDNESDAYS 7:00–9:40PM <br><br>
63 5TH AVE. ROOM 200<br><br>
INSTRUCTOR: Aarati Akkapeddi, akkaa949@newschool.edu<br><br>


This class explores advanced web programming as a medium for amplifying and expanding on traditional communication design principles. It builds upon a foundational knowledge of Javascript: moving beyond its interactive and generative qualities, and incorporating semi-advanced concepts including APIs & databases, cookies, multiple-user driven applications, drawing libraries, and more. Through a mix of lectures, readings, weekly assignments, and individual projects, students will explore coding as a design methodology in the intersection of critical thinking and creative practice. Students will be challenged to think abstractly about theoretical and practical implications of code-driven design, applied within “real-world-inspired” projects.
